# Solar_System
The Third game created by me on 21/12/2021. The Teacher from Physics announced that we were to do a presentation or other artistic work, so I thought I would create a game and there it is. Information about the planets I took from various sites (mainly wikipedia) and it is not copied but changed so that it looks better and was in "one sentence" and it took me all day. The textures of the planets I downloaded from a site that cooperates with NASA and which got the textures from them. The music that is in the background changes every time you fire up the game randomly (there are 6 different songs). Created in about a Month.<br/>
